**Machine Learning Project: Job Listing Skill Extraction using NLP and Embeddings (Academic Year 2023/2024)**

This project focuses on extracting relevant skills required for a specific job listing using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and embedding techniques.
Given a job advertisement, the model analyzes the text and identifies a list of skills necessary for the position.
The process involves preprocessing the job description, applying NLP techniques, and utilizing Google word embeddings to understand the contextual meaning of the skills mentioned in the listing.
